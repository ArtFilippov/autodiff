# autodiff: Forward Mode Automatic Differentiation for C++

Welcome to autodiff, a self-written ะก++ module designed to empower your computational projects with the capabilities of Forward Mode Automatic Differentiation (AD). autodiff is perfect for applications in machine learning, optimization, numerical methods, and any domain requiring precise and efficient derivative calculations. Alongside the core module, autodiff is accompanied by a demonstration application built with Qt, showcasing the practical applications and ease of use of the module.

## What is Forward Mode Automatic Differentiation?

Automatic Differentiation (AD) is a computational technique for evaluating the derivative of a function specified by a computer program. Unlike symbolic or numerical differentiation, AD computes derivatives to machine precision with high efficiency. Forward mode AD augments arithmetic and function operations to simultaneously compute values and their derivatives, making it exceptionally suited for applications where derivatives are computed with respect to a small number of input variables.

## Key Features of autodiff

- **Multi-threading Support**: autodiff is designed to take advantage of multi-core processors, providing parallel access to the parameters of differentiable functions.
- **Dynamic Function Assembly**: The encapsulation of operations and functions into classes allows for the dynamic creation of new functions, offering unparalleled flexibility for on-the-fly computations.
- **High Precision and Efficiency**: autodiff bypasses the drawbacks of symbolic and numerical differentiation, providing exact derivatives efficiently and accurately.

## Qt Demonstration Application

Included with the autodiff module is a Qt-based application that demonstrates the module's capabilities. This application allows users to input variable names and the right-hand side of equations (assuming the left-hand side is zero) and solves them using the gradient descent method. It serves as an excellent starting point for understanding how autodiff can be applied in real-world scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with autodiff and the Qt demonstration application, clone the repository and follow the setup instructions provided in the documentation. The library is designed for easy integration, and the demo application offers a straightforward example of how to leverage autodiff in your projects.
